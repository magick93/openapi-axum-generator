# Current Issue: Schema Field Access Error

## Problem Description
The template system is failing with an error when trying to access the `schema_kind` field on a `&Schema` reference. The specific error is:

```
error[E0609]: no field `schema_kind` on type `&Schema`
```

This occurs in the handlers template when trying to generate struct fields from OpenAPI schema definitions. The current implementation assumes direct field access, but the openapiv3 crate's Schema type requires proper dereferencing and field access patterns.

## Proposed Solution
1. Modify the template to properly handle the reference type
2. Use the correct field access pattern for schema_kind
3. Add proper error handling for missing or invalid fields
4. Simplify the template logic to focus on essential functionality

The fix will involve:
- Using proper dereferencing patterns
- Adding null checks and error handling
- Simplifying the property access chain
- Maintaining compatibility with the openapiv3 crate's type system
